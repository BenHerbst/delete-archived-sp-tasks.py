# delete-archived-sp-tasks.py
Removes all archived super productivity tasks. Just run the python script. This is helpful to do a cleanup every 3-6 months.

NOTE: You lose your working time of the archived tasks.

To use it, start the python script with your exported json file as argument, like: python delete-archived.py C:/Users/Test/super-produvtivity-backup.json
Note that you first have to export your data.
You can then import your json file after running the small script.

This can make your sync faster and reduce keeping old tasks.
